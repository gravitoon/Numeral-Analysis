Numerical Analysis by
Richard L. Burden, Douglas J. Faires and Annette M. Burden 10e

These are my python code implementations to the algorithms presented in the book. Following 
the suggestion in the book for someone who has never formally taken a numerical analysis,
the first pass will cover chapters 1, 6, 7 and 9. I am however starting with chapter 2 and then
following the suggested material. Then I want to follow another suggested guideline starting 
with Chapter 3, 4, 11 and 12.

Where an algorithm was provided in a given section, I wrote the python code for and try to 
provide not only the solution but where possible replicate the iterations/tables presented in the 
book as part of the solution.
